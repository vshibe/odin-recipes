        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A recipe for a sirloin steak, lifted from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14554/sirloin-steak-with-garlic-butter/">allrecipes.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup of butter.</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced.</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder.</li>
            <li>4 pounds beef top sirloin steaks.</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>Stir in minced garlic and garlic powder. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Season both sides of each steak with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place steaks on preheated grill and cook 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium doneness.</li>
            <li>Transfer steaks to warmed plates; brush the tops liberally with garlic butter and allow to rest for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.</li>
